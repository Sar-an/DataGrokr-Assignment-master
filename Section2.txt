	SELECT * FROM Products WHERE UnitPrice > (SELECT AVG(UnitPrice) FROM Products);

	SELECT Orders.EmployeeID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName, COUNT(OrderID) AS Total_sales FROM Orders JOIN Employees
    	ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID GROUP BY Orders.EmployeeID HAVING Total_sales>70;



3) Identify the customers who have active orders.

	SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.ContactName FROM Customers RIGHT OUTER JOIN Orders
    	ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID WHERE ShippedDate IS NOT NULL;



4) Find the customer with maximum number of orders. 

	SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(OrderID) AS Number_of_Orders FROM Orders
    	GROUP BY CustomerID ORDER BY COUNT(OrderID) desc LIMIT 1;

	FROM OrderDetails LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN Employees ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID
    LEFT OUTER JOIN Products ON Products.ProductID = OrderDetails.ProductID
    WHERE ProductName = "Gravad Lax" OR ProductName = "Mishi Kobe Niku";
